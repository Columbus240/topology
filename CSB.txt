Investigating the equivalence between the Cantor-Schröder-Bernstein and the law
of excluded middle,
or
Notes on “Cantor-Bernstein implies Excluded Middle”.

The statement of the Cantor-Schröder-Bernstein theorem (CSB) in set-theory is:
let A, B be sets and f: A→B, g:B→A be injective functions. Then there exists a
bijection h:A→B.

The statement of the law of excluded middle (LEM) is:
let P be a proposition then P∨¬P holds.

I formalised in Coq that these statements (formulated in terms of the CoC and
the Coq std. library) are equivalent given some axioms.

A proof in Coq that
(1) LEM ∧ ConstructiveDefiniteDescription ⇒ CSB
was already given in the ZornsLemma library. [!reference!]

By following the proof in [!reference,paper!], I formalised
(2) CSB ∧ FunctionExtensionality ∧ ProofIrrelevance ⇒ LEM.

I conjecture that
(3) Univalence ⇒ (CSB ⇐⇒ LEM)
in the setting of the HoTT library.

Let Setoid_CSB be the statement CSB for setoids, i.e.:
“Let A, B be types, each with some equivalence relation. let f:A→B, g:B→A be
functions that respect these equivalence relations and are injective relative
to the equiv. relations. Then there exists a function h:A→B that respects the
equiv. relations and is bijective relative to the equiv. relations.”

Then we can adapt the proof of (2) to obtain
(4) Setoid_CSB ⇒ LEM
in Coq without assuming any further axioms.

By adapting the proof of (1) we can obtain
(5) LEM ∧ ConstructiveIndefiniteDescription ⇒ Setoid_CSB.

I’d like to use a weaker axiom than CID for (5), but I don’t think it’s
possible. But on the other hand, I believe that Setoid_CSB is not much stronger
than LEM in terms of choice axioms. (I believe Setoid_CSB is strictly weaker
than any choice-axiom that is stronger than LEM)
