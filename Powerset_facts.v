Lemma Intersection_Full_set
  {X : Type}
  {U : Ensemble X} :
  Intersection Full_set U = U.
Proof.
now extensionality_ensembles.
Qed.

Lemma Intersection_associative
  {X : Type}
  (U V W: Ensemble X) :
  Intersection (Intersection U V) W = Intersection U (Intersection V W).
Proof.
now extensionality_ensembles.
Qed.
